# Base 10 Numbering System

```
Base 10 Numbering System :
• The numbering system people use it the Base 10 numbering system, also called Decimal system.
• We use 10 symbols to represent values from 0 to 9.
• Each value in the position to the left is multiplied by 10 times the value located in the position to the right.
• We have 1000s, 100s, 10s, 1s, and so on.
• 4 * 1000 + 7 * 100 + 8 * 10 + 3 * 1 = 4783

# Binary 2 Numbering System

```
Base 2 Numbering System also called Binary :
• It only use 2 symbols : 0 and 1
• Each value symbol to the left is multiplied by 2 times the value of the symbol to the right.
• As result, we have 16s, 8s, 4s, 2s, and 1s.
• 1 * 16 + 0 * 8 + 1 * 4 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 1 = 10111, The decimal equivalent is 23
• All numbers in Binary are represented by 1s and 0s.
• In electronics, 1 is represented by power being On or at a Higher Voltage.
• 0 is represented by power being Off or at Lower Voltage.
• In networking, we usually only need to convert numbers with 8 bits or less.
