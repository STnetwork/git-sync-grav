Base 10 Numbering System :
• The numbering system people use it the Base 10 numbering system, also called Decimal system.
• We use 10 symbols to represent values from 0 to 9.
• Each value in the position to the left is multiplied by 10 times the value located in the position to the right.
• We have 1000s, 100s, 10s, 1s, and so on.
• 4 * 1000 + 7 * 100 + 8 * 10 + 3 * 1 = 4783
