```
* Older technology
* Technology is falling out of use in favor of switches.
* Work on Layer 1 of OSI Model.
* Logically function as a Bus Topology.
* Too many hosts can result in constant collisions.
```
Three Main Types of **HUB** :
* **Passive hubs**
	* Works like a cable splitters.
	* The more devices, the weaker the signal to each device.
* **Active hubs**
	* Need a power source
	* Power added to the signal when passed though port.
	* Prevents weakening of signal by multiple devices.
	* Repeats signal to all hosts connected to hub.
	* They can be used to connect multiple hubs.
	* When connecting hubs, must follow 5-4-3 rule.
	* No more than 5 segments can be linked together.
	* Up to 4 linking devices only can be used to form segments.
	* Only 3 segments can be populated by computers. 
* **Intelligent hubs**
	* They are really active hubs with additional features.
	* Some have network diagnostic abilities
	* Some have management abilities
	* Intelligent hubs with other abilities are available.
