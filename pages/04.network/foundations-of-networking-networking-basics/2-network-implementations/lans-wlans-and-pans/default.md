## LANs

* Limited in size.
* Can be a small as a single room or big as a building.
* Can also span several buildings close together.
* TIA/EIA 568-C Standard defines characteristics of LANs.
* Normally uses twisted pair cabling to connect devices.
* Should use CAT 6 or 6A in current LAN builds.
* Hierarchical Star only Topology recognized by 568-C.
* LAN Nodes tied together with Switches or Hubs.
* Can use Fiber Optic cables to connect Switches.

## WLANs

* Stands for Wireless Local Area Networks.
* Is a Standard LAN that uses Wireless Technologies.
* Wireless Technologies commonly referred to as Wi-Fi.
* Wi-Fi Technologies defined by IEEE 802.11 Standard.
* IEEE 802.11ac - most current Wi-Fi Standard.
* More advanced IEEE 802.11ax Standard being developed.

## PANs

* Stands for Personal Area Networks.
* Defined by IEEE 802.15 Standard group.
* Primarily uses Blue Tooth Technologies for connecting.
* Limited range of less than 30 feet.
* Devices like Keyboards and Mice can use PANs to connect to a computer.
* Many Phones use PANs to connect accessories.
* Earbuds to use phones while driving use PANs.
* Some watches use PANs to connect to Smartphones.
* Infrared (IrDA) can also be used.
