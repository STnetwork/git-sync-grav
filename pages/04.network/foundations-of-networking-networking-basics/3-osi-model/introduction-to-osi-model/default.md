![](Intro-OSI.png?cropResize=500,500)   {.center}


The **OSI Model** when it was first created came out in two parts :
	* The First part was the **Abstract Model**.
		* The actual model with its seven layers.
	* The Second part was actually a **Set of specially created protocols**, that was designed to illustrate how the protocols would fit inside this **abstract model**. 
		* Protocols not actually used in any network system.
		
```
* Devices to teach how protocols work with Networks to carry data.
* Model for organizations creating new protocols.
* Stands for Open Systems Interconnection Reference Model.
* Created as a Reference Model and Teaching aid.
* Not intended to reflect any actual network architecture.
```

**Mnemonics** for memorize these Layers in the proper order :

* **A**ll **P**eople **S**eem **T**o **N**eed **D**ata **P**rocessing.
* **P**lease **D**o **N**ot **T**hrow **S**ausage **P**izza **A**way
